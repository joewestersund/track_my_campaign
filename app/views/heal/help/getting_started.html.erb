  <h2>Welcome to the <%= current_db.instance_name %> HEAL Cities database!</h2>

  <p>It's designed to help you organize and track your HEAL Cities work.</p>

  <h2>Logins</h2>
  <p>The database works best if each user has their own login.
    <ul>
      <li><%= link_to "Users for your database", heal_help_users_path %></li>
      <li><%= mail_to "joe.westersund@gmail.com", "Contact me to have a new user set up"%></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>How it's organized</h2>
  <p>
    The database thinks about your HEAL Cities work in this way:
    <ul>
      <li><%= link_to "Cities", heal_help_cities_path %>, the cities and other jurisdictions that you want to influence</li>
      <li><%= link_to "Contacts", heal_help_contacts_path %>, the people that you'll talk to, at cities or other organizations</li>
      <li><%= link_to "Communications", heal_help_communications_path %>, the meetings, phone calls, and other communications you'll have with those people</li>
      <li><%= link_to "Successes", heal_help_successes_path %>, the actions that those cities will (hopefully) take to help people live healthier.</li>
      <li><%= link_to "Task Assignments", heal_help_task_assignments_path %>, reminders or goals that you set for yourself or your teammates</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    For each of these, you can view the data, filter the view to a subset you're interested in, and add, edit, or delete records.
  </p>
  <p>
    These types are all linked together, so you'll be able to know, "who do we know at that city?" and,
    "When was the last time we talked to someone at that city?"
  </p>
  <p>
    The data is shared with everyone at your organization, so you can know if someone else has already talked to the city or contact you want to reach.
